# DataStructures-Visualizer
Visualization tool for data structures such as Binary Tree, Binary Heap, Linked List, Stack, and others. You can visualize the main operations of each data structures, and how these operations modify the data structures. The animations were done with CSS and Scalable Vector Graphics ( svg tag on HTML).
  
# Binary Search Tree

Operations: Insert, Search, Delete

You can see how the operations alter the tree while maintaining its property: The value of a given node is greater than all the values in its left subtree, and lesser than all the value in its right subtree.

# Linked List

Operations: Insert, Search, Delete

You can see how the data structure maintain a linear sequence of the items, while storing them in random memory adresses, and how these items can be reached by using pointers.

# Stack
  
  Operations: Push, Pop
  
 You can see how only the element at the top can be acessed at any moment, and how this property help maintain the data.

 Visualization for other data structures are still in development.
